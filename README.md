# niche_generator
Slightly bad niche generator written in python.

How to use:
``` BASH
$ cd src
$ python myexp.txt 100 resultl.csv
```

The file `myexp.txt` is a file that contains at least 10 experiences you have.
Example:
``` text
Flower gardner
Clay pot maker
Programming in Python
.
.
.
Beard trimmer
```
The results is then randomly generated and stored in `results.csv`
I take it back, its extremely bad nice generator.
